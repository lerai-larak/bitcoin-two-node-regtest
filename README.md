## bitcoin-two-node-regtest
This project aims at understanding bitcoin fundamentals by trying the out basic operations in the bitcoin system from the terminal. 

Using docker, it creates two bitcoin nodes which you can connect to from your local machine using bitcoin's RPC interface. With this setup which simulates remote nodes, you just use your locally installed `bitcoin-cli` to connect to the nodes and issue commands. This way, you can easily drop the docker container hoslding the nodes and start again from scratch. 

Your local bitcoin installation remains untouched.

## Setup
Install Docker
Install Bitcoin Core on you local.
Clone repo and start the nodes. Use the script to start and stop the nodes.
