## bitcoin-two-node-regtest
This project aims at understanding bitcoin fundamentals by trying the out basic operations in the bitcoin system from the terminal. 

Using docker, it creates two bitcoin nodes which you can connect to from your local machine using bitcoin's RPC interface. With this setup which simulates remote nodes, your locally installed `bitcoin-cli` just connects to the nodes and issues commands. Your local bitcoin installation remains untouched and you can easily drop the docker container holding the nodes and start again from scratch. 

The `control_nodes.sh` script file contains functions that allow you to start, stop and remove the nodes.



## Setup
Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started): The nodes are created as Docker containers and therefore need the environment to run from. To see how they are created, see the `docker-compose.yml` file in the repo.

Install [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) on you local machine: You need a local installation to be able to connect to the 'remote' nodes using the `bitcoin-cli` tool which comes with bitcoin. 

Clone repo and start the nodes. Use the script to start and stop the nodes.
